# OGL3D-Engine

This is my own game engine. It was made entirely by me for making games, it was abandoned since 2023 because it implementation of functions was very slow, if you want to use it, dont forget to credit me.

# How to build

Firstly, install MSYS2,
Then open it and write command "pacman -S make gcc".
When its done, enter the project directory and write command "make", if everything works, you should get an executable in the folder,
if not, write issue in github in this repository.
